## About me

I'm a 4th-year Computer Engineering student at Pibulsongkram Rajabhat University,  
Faculty of Industrial Technology.

I'm passionate about frontend development and UX/UI design, and currently learning how to work with databases and build APIs to create clean, user-friendly interfaces that deliver great user experiences.

After graduation, I hope to work as a Frontend Developer,  
and if possible, pursue a Master's degree in the future.

In my free time, I love playing games with friends on Discordâ€”it helps me relax and stay connected.
